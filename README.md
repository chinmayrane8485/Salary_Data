# Create a Random Forest Regressor model
# Evaluate the model

#Mean Squared Error (MSE):
1. MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.
2. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance.
3. It is commonly used for regression problems.

#R-squared (Coefficient of Determination):
1. R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (target) that is predictable from the independent variables (features).
2. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.
3. R-squared helps assess how well the model captures the variance in the target variable.
